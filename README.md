# Elliot's journal

A reflective journal that shows you the past as you jot down the present. Imagine typing June 6th 2026's journal entry, and seeing the past June 6th entries from 2025, 2024, and beyond.
This idea was from a conversation with my wife who mentioned that Jim Elliot used to keep a journal that showed him what he'd been doing, feeling, thinking in the past year(s), for each day he wrote in it.
